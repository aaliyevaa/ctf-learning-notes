## Description

Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website.
As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret.
Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?


## Hints

1. Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?
2. Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
3. Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.


## Tools

No external tools were used.


## Steps taken. 

1. As the name as well as the hints suggested I checked the cookies of the webpage by inspecting.

2. Value of the cookie was a Base-64 encoded string. I decoded it and obtained the flag.


## What I learned

1. Base-64 encoded strings are common in CTFs.
2. Burpsuite can be used to analyze cookies too; however I haven't used it for this challenge
